Description: Provides functions for the evaluation of basket
    trial designs with binary endpoints. Operating characteristics of a
    basket trial design are assessed by simulating trial data according to
    scenarios, analyzing the data with Bayesian hierarchical models (BHMs), and
    assessing decision probabilities based on Go / No-go decision making.
    The BHMs proposed by
    Berry et al. (2013) <doi:10.1177/1740774513497539>
    and Neuenschwander et al. (2016) <doi:10.1002/pst.1730>,
    as well as a model that combines both approaches are implemented.
    Functions are provided to implement Bayesian decision rules as for example
    proposed by Fisch et al. (2015) <doi:10.1177/2168479014533970>.
    In addition, posterior point estimates (mean/median) and credible intervals
    for response rates and some model parameters can be calculated.
    For simulated trial data, bias and mean squared errors of posterior
    point estimates for response rates can be provided.
